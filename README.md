#This repository was created by Priya Bhanot and Mira White for CLPS0950
This repositoory features two major scripts: faceGenerator and faceFinder
The script faceGenerator creates a matrix called 'image' of n size that can be modified to display a face (as defined in the code) or not-a-face. This generator will create inputs for the faceFinder function. For best results, n >= 9. 
The script faceFinder takes the input image from faceGenerator and outputs which the facial features (nose, eyes, mouth) are present, and if there is a full face present.
